/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Biding. In this instance the 'this' will refer to whatever window you are using. 
* 2. Implicit Binding. In this instance the 'this' is implied. 
    When calling a function with a . 'this' is whatever is left of the dot. 
* 3. New Binding. When a constructor is used, the 'this' is the NEW object. 
* 4. Explicit Binding. This is when you use a build in JS function like call() or apply() that is 
    specifically created to tell 'this' what to be. 
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
